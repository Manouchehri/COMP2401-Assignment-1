# Folder Structure

- `src/` - All the source files are included here.
- `bin/` - Prebuilt binaries can be located here.

# Running

If you are using Linux, simply run `./bin/[filename here]` to execute the program. For Windows, open up `cmd`, drag and drop the `.exe` in `bin/`, and the program will start (if you double click, the program will run and close immediately).

# Compiling

All the submitted binaries are statically compiled and should not require recompiling. Please note that the Makefile is not meant to be used for beginners, as it requires installing dependencies outside the scope of this course. If you feel the need to do this anyway, please speak to the SCS help desk or use Google; I do not provide troubleshooting for trivial problems unrelated to coursework. Everything required to mark this assignment has been included.
